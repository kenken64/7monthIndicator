git commit -m "feat: Migrate to modular git worktree structure

üèóÔ∏è  Architecture Changes:
- Split monolith into 4 independent services
- Created core/ for shared components (config, database, utilities)
- Added service-specific environment configurations
- Updated import paths for modular structure
- Created individual service startup scripts

ü§ñ Services:
- services/trading/ - RL-enhanced trading bot
- services/web-dashboard/ - Flask web interface  
- services/chart-analysis/ - AI-powered chart analysis
- services/mcp-server/ - Model Context Protocol server

üì¶ Core Components:
- core/config.py - Centralized configuration
- core/database.py - Database management
- core/utils/ - Shared utilities and environment loading

üîß Management:
- scripts/restart_all.sh - Master service control
- Individual service startup scripts
- Service-specific requirements.txt files
