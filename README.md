# CryptoCurrency AI Trading Bot Dashboard (Experimental) ü§ñ

## Advanced AI-Powered Trading System with Cross-Asset Correlation Analysis

## It's Like a Point-Scoring Game! üéØ

Imagine you're trying to decide whether to buy or sell something (like trading cards), but you don't want to make a bad choice. So you have a special rule: you need to collect at least 3 points before you can make a trade.

### How You Get Points:

**MACD Signals (¬±1 point each) üìà**
- Think of this like watching how fast a race car is speeding up or slowing down
- If the car is speeding up = +1 point (good to buy)
- If it's slowing down = -1 point (maybe sell)

**VWAP Signal (¬±1 point) ‚öñÔ∏è**
- This is like seeing who's winning in a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers
- If buyers are stronger = +1 point
- If sellers are stronger = -1 point

**EMA Signals (Different point values) üìä**
- These are like looking at different time periods to see which way things are moving:
  - Short-term trend (9 days): ¬±1 point
  - Medium-term crossover (9 vs 21 days): ¬±2 points
  - Longer trends (50 and 200 days): ¬±1 point each
  - Big trend change: ¬±3 points (this is like a really important signal!)

**RSI Signal (¬±1 point) üå°Ô∏è**
- This is like a thermometer that tells you if something is "too hot" (expensive) or "too cold" (cheap)
- If it's too expensive = -1 point
- If it's too cheap = +1 point

### The Rule:
You can only make a trade when you collect at least 3 points in the same direction. It's like needing enough friends to agree with you before making a big decision!

This way, you don't make trades based on just one signal - you wait until multiple "friends" (indicators) agree with you first! ü§ù

## ü§ñ RL Model Retraining

The bot includes an advanced RL model retraining system that learns from your actual trading data to improve decision-making over time.

### üîß How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The bot continuously stores signals, trades, and outcomes in a SQLite database
2. **Outcome Analysis**: Real trade results are categorized (good_profit, small_profit, small_loss, bad_loss)
3. **Enhanced Reward System**: The RL agent learns with rewards/penalties based on actual P&L
4. **Continuous Learning**: Model improves its decision-making based on historical patterns

### üìä Retraining Process

#### Automatic Backup
Before retraining, your current model is automatically backed up:
```bash
# Backup is created with timestamp
rl_trading_model_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pkl
```

#### Manual Retraining
To retrain your RL model with fresh data:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run retraining (requires sufficient data)
python3 retrain_rl_model.py
```

#### What Happens During Retraining:
1. **Data Preparation**: Loads signals and trade outcomes from database (last 30 days)
2. **Enhanced Learning**: Uses improved reward system:
   - **Big rewards** for profitable trades (>2% profit)
   - **Heavy penalties** for large losses (>2% loss)
   - **Streak bonuses/penalties** for consecutive wins/losses
   - **Smart HOLD rewards** for avoiding bad trades
3. **Training Episodes**: Runs 150 training episodes with real market scenarios
4. **Model Updates**: Saves improved model with enhanced decision-making
5. **Backup Creation**: Creates episodic backups every 50 episodes

### üìà Retraining Requirements

- **Minimum Data**: 50+ signals with indicators (usually 1-2 hours of bot runtime)
- **Optimal Data**: 2000+ signals with trade outcomes (24-48 hours of runtime)
- **Best Results**: 30+ days of trading data with varied market conditions

### üéØ Enhanced Logic After Retraining

The retrained model implements intelligent position management:

#### HOLD Signal Logic
```
Current Position: LONG +$50 PnL ‚Üí HOLD Signal
Result: ‚úÖ Position kept open (positive PnL)
Log: "HOLD signal detected - keeping LONG position open (positive PnL: $50.00)"

Current Position: LONG -$30 PnL ‚Üí HOLD Signal  
Result: ‚ùå Position closed (negative PnL)
Log: "HOLD signal detected - closing LONG position (negative PnL: $-30.00)"
```

#### Signal Flip Logic
```
Current Position: LONG +$50 PnL ‚Üí SELL Signal
Result: ‚úÖ Keep LONG position (profitable)
Log: "SELL signal detected with open LONG position - keeping position open (positive PnL: $50.00)"

Current Position: LONG -$30 PnL ‚Üí SELL Signal
Result: ‚ùå Close LONG, Open SHORT (cutting losses)
Log: "SELL signal detected with open LONG position - closing due to negative PnL: $-30.00"
Log: "üìà Executing new trade after closing opposite position based on SELL signal..."
```

### üìã Retraining Results Analysis

After retraining, the system provides detailed analysis:

```
üéâ Retraining complete! Best performance: 0.2%
üìä Recent Performance (last 50 episodes):
   Average win rate: 49.1%
   Average return: -0.0%
   Average trades per episode: 34.4
   Total states learned: 13
   Total episodes: 155
üìà Learning Progress:
   Early episodes avg return: 0.0%
   Recent episodes avg return: -0.0%
   Improvement: -0.0%
```

### üîÑ When to Retrain

- **After significant market changes** (new volatility patterns)
- **Weekly/bi-weekly** for optimal performance
- **After 100+ closed trades** for maximum learning benefit
- **When win rate drops** below acceptable levels

### üíæ Model Files

- `rl_trading_model.pkl` - Current active model
- `rl_trading_model_backup_*.pkl` - Timestamped backups
- `rl_trading_model_episode_*.pkl` - Training checkpoint backups

### üß™ Testing Retrained Models

After retraining, test the model's recommendations:
```bash
python3 -c "
from lightweight_rl import LightweightRLSystem
rl = LightweightRLSystem()
recommendation = rl.get_trading_recommendation({
    'rsi': 45, 'macd': -0.01, 'price': 3.68,
    'vwap': 3.70, 'ema_9': 3.65, 'ema_21': 3.67
})
print(f'Action: {recommendation[\"action\"]}, Confidence: {recommendation[\"confidence\"]:.1%}')
"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### Trading Bot Issues
- **API Permission Error**: Enable Futures trading in API settings
- **Insufficient Balance**: Ensure adequate USDC balance for SUIUSDC trading
- **Symbol Not Found**: Check symbol formatting (e.g., 'SUIUSDC')
- **Margin Type Error**: May be already set to CROSS (this is normal)
- **Rate Limiting**: Reduce check frequency if needed
- **Position Size Error**: Check symbol precision and minimum order size

#### RL Model Issues
- **"No module named 'numpy'"**: Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- **"Insufficient data for training"**: Let bot run for at least 2-3 hours before retraining
- **"Model file not found"**: First time setup - model will be created automatically
- **Poor RL performance**: Need more diverse trading data; run bot through different market conditions
- **Retraining takes too long**: Reduce episodes in `retrain_rl_model.py` (default: 150)

#### Chart Analysis Bot Issues
- **"Missing OpenAI API key"**: Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file
- **"Model not found" errors**: OpenAI deprecated older models, bot uses `gpt-4o`
- **"Chart generation failed"**: Check if `mplfinance` is installed: `pip install mplfinance`
- **"No chart analysis data"**: Bot runs every 15 minutes, wait for first cycle
- **Chart not displaying**: Check web dashboard at `/api/chart-image` endpoint

#### Web Dashboard Issues  
- **Dashboard not accessible**: Check if port 5000 is open and not blocked by firewall
- **Chart image not loading**: Verify chart analysis bot is running: `./start_chart_bot.sh status`
- **PIN protection not working**: Ensure `BOT_CONTROL_PIN` is set in `.env` file
- **Mobile display issues**: Dashboard is responsive, try refreshing or clearing cache
- **Market news not showing**: Verify `NEWS_API_KEY` is set in `.env` file
- **Sentiment analysis not working**: Check OpenAI API key and ensure sufficient credits
- **News pagination errors**: Restart web dashboard: `./start_web_dashboard.sh restart`

#### Database Issues  
- **"Database locked"**: Stop bot before running retraining: `./start_rl_bot.sh stop`
- **"No signals in database"**: Let bot run and collect data first
- **Database corruption**: Backup and delete `trading_bot.db`, bot will recreate it

### Error Logs:
- **Standard Bot**: Check `trading_bot.log` 
- **RL Bot**: Check `logs/rl_bot_main.log` and `logs/rl_bot_error.log`
- **Chart Analysis Bot**: Check `chart_analysis_bot.log`
- **Web Dashboard**: Check `web_dashboard.log`
- **Retraining**: Check `rl_retraining.log`
- **Web Interface**: Access all logs via dashboard at `/logs`

### Debugging Tips:
- Start with testnet mode first
- Use smaller position percentages initially (2% instead of 51%)
- Monitor liquidation prices closely
- Check Binance API status if experiencing connection issues
- For RL issues, check if database contains enough data: `ls -la *.db`
- Monitor all bot statuses: 
  - `./start_rl_bot.sh status`
  - `./start_chart_bot.sh status`  
  - `./start_web_dashboard.sh status`
- Access web dashboard for real-time monitoring and chart analysis

### RL Model Recovery:
If RL model becomes corrupted:
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp rl_trading_model_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pkl rl_trading_model.pkl

# Or start fresh (will retrain automatically)
rm rl_trading_model.pkl
./start_rl_bot.sh restart
```
