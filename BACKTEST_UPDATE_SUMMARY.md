# Backtesting System Update - Summary

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. **Database Discovery**

**Problem**: The backtest was reading from `/root/7monthIndicator/trading_bot.db` which only had 28 HOLD signals from September 7, 2025 (40 minutes of data).

**Solution**: Found the shared database at `/root/7monthIndicator/shared/databases/trading_bot.db` with:
- **43,081 total signals**
- **1,096 SELL signals (2.54%)**
- **427 BUY signals (0.99%)**
- **41,558 HOLD signals (96.46%)**
- **Date range**: August 24, 2025 to September 7, 2025 (~2 weeks of data)

**Implementation**: Updated all backtest endpoints to use `shared/databases/trading_bot.db`

### 2. **PIN Protection Added**

**Feature**: Weight optimization now requires the same 6-digit PIN as the bot pause function.

**How It Works**:
- User clicks "🎯 Optimize Weights" button
- Browser prompts for 6-digit PIN
- PIN is validated server-side with rate limiting
- After 3 failed attempts: 15-minute lockout
- Same security as bot control pause/resume

## 📊 Updated Data Availability

Your database now shows:
```
Total Signals: 43,081
├── BUY: 427 (0.99%)
├── SELL: 1,096 (2.54%)
└── HOLD: 41,558 (96.46%)

Date Range: 2025-08-24 to 2025-09-07 (14 days)
Status: ✅ Ready for backtesting
```
